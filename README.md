# Warrior Cat & Clan Generator!

Ever wanted inspiration for cat names, fur patterns, and eye colors for your Warrior Cats fan fiction? Yes, that's exactly what you've been mising all your life? Perfect! Because I, too, have suffered from the scorching dearth of warrior cat name inspiration and manual labor of generating background character cats! Hence, high school me collected a number of warrior cat prefixes, suffixes, colors, and patterns, for a stunning total of 9,869,563 possible cats that get randomly generated and placed into clans!

Features:
- Over 9 million possible different cats with different names, colors, and fur patterns
- Generates cats into a fully-fleshed clan structure, with all four original clans from the book and all positions filled
- Full warrior names provided for apprentices, leaders, and other cats with past or future name changes
